  ------- MODEL REPORT ------
  The un-condensed model contains:
      283 variables comprising 2840 thousand components
  and 332 equation blocks comprising 2330 thousand separate equations.
  
      72 variables (comprising 1218 thousand components) will be backsolved for.
      0 variables (comprising 0 components) were substituted out.
      1 variables (comprising 27 thousand components) were omitted.
  
  So the condensed model contains:
      210 variables comprising 1594 thousand components
  and 260 equation blocks comprising 1112 thousand separate equations.

  %% ADVICE. During this run MMNZ,MMNZ1 were
       reallocated 5 times. This may have
     slowed down this run considerably.
   We strongly suggest that you include an appropriate
     statement of the form "start with mmnz = <value> ;"
       in your Command file.
   [See Section 32.3 of the GEMPACK Manual, "MMNZ: Allocating memory for the LU
    decomposition".][TopicID:gpd3.13.3]
   [Be guided by the minimum values shown just above.]
  
  Total memory currently used for all arrays is approximately 368.50 megabytes.
  [This does NOT include memory related to MMNZ, MMNZ1 and MMNZ2. The
   associated arrays are not allocated.]
  [Add about 5-10 megabytes for the memory used by the code.]
  [The likely maximum memory used in this run has
    been reported earlier - search for "most memory".]
  
  
  Maximum residual ratio across whole simulation is 1.30839112E-07
